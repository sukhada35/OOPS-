//2.	Develop an Employee Attendance Management System using Java packages. 
//Create a package attendance and define a class EmployeeAttendance in EmployeeAttendance.java. 
//Declare variables such as name, empID, totalWorkingDays, daysPresent, daysAbsent, and attendancePercentage. 
//Implement methods to calculate attendance percentage and display attendance records. 
//In another file AttendanceReport.java, create an object, input attendance details, compute the percentage, and print the attendance summary.

package attendance;
