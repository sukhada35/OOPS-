//2. Write a program that prompts the user to input two numbers and then divides the first number by the second number.
// Handle the case where the second number is zero by catching the arithmetic exception and displaying a message 
//such as "Cannot divide by zero." Ensure that the program handles valid input, even when a zero divisor is entered.
